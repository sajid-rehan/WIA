Here is the output:

**<style>**
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>**

This code sets a serifenless font (Arial) for the entire page using CSS. It also defines styles for headings (h1-h6) to make them bold.

Let me know if you'd like me to apply this style to a specific text or content!
